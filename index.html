        <h1>AVL Tree Visualization</h1>
        <p>
            This visualization demonstrates the operations of an AVL tree, a self-balancing binary search tree. 
            The AVL tree maintains its balance through rotations during insertions and deletions to ensure that 
            the height difference between the left and right subtrees of any node is at most one.
        </p>
        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>
            You can insert or remove values using the input field and buttons below. The tree will automatically 
            rebalance itself after each operation. The heights (H) and balance factors (BF) of the nodes will 
            be updated accordingly and displayed next to each node.
        </p>
        <h3>Height</h3>
        <p>
            The height of a node is defined as the number of edges on the longest path from the node to a leaf. 
            Leaf nodes have a height of 0. For example, if a node has a left child with height 1 and a right child 
            with height 2, the height of this node will be 3.
        </p>
        <h3>Balance Factor</h3>
        <p>
            The balance factor of a node is the difference between the heights of the left and right subtrees of that node. 
            It is calculated as:
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Balance Factor = Height of Left Subtree - Height of Right Subtree</strong></p>
        <p>
            A node is considered balanced if its balance factor is -1, 0, or 1. If the balance factor of a node 
            becomes less than -1 or greater than 1, rotations are performed to rebalance the tree.
        </p>
        <h3>Rotations</h3>
        <p>
            There are four types of rotations used to maintain the AVL tree balance:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Left Rotation:</strong> Performed when the right subtree is higher.</li>
                <li><strong>Right Rotation:</strong> Performed when the left subtree is higher.</li>
                <li><strong>Left-Right Rotation:</strong> A combination of left and right rotations.</li>
                <li><strong>Right-Left Rotation:</strong> A combination of right and left rotations.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
