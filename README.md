# AVL-Tree-Visualization

This project demonstrates the operations of an AVL tree, a self-balancing binary search tree, using D3.js for visualization. 

## Overview

An AVL tree maintains its balance through rotations during insertions and deletions to ensure that the height difference between the left and right subtrees of any node is at most one. This visualization shows the structure of an AVL tree and allows users to insert and remove nodes. The tree will automatically rebalance itself after each operation.

## How to Access

1. Clone the repository.

2. Open \`index.html\` in your web browser to view and interact with the AVL tree visualization.
